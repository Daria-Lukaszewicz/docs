There is a wide range of available filters for transactions that can be useful if you need to sort out the transactions by the specified parameter \(currency, time, status, etc\). Also, you can export this info into a .csv file by pressing the “Export” button in the right corner of this menu.

You can get additional info on the transactions by pressing the “Info” button on the right side of the transaction that you want to check.
