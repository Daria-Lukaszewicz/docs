# Bank Accounts and Fiat Transactions

Let’s address the “Bank accounts” tab. It's possible to conduct fiat transactions by using our business solution, you can top up your merchant account balance in fiat via bank transfer and add a bank account, in case you want to withdraw the fiat funds to it.  
  
You can add a bank account by pressing the “Add Bank Account” button, but it needs to be approved by our team first.

Once it’s done, you will be able to use this account to withdraw your fiat funds from the merchant account. At the moment fiat transactions in EUR and USD are available.  
  
To withdraw fiat funds you need to press the “Withdrawal” button near the corresponding fiat currency on the tab[ “Balances”](account-balance-and-addresses.md). Once it’s done you will need to choose the bank account that you’ve added and specify the withdrawal amount.
